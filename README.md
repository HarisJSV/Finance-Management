Hexaware's Coding Challenge (C#)
So, according to the instructions given my hexaware, I am suppose to create a system that allows user to create, delete and update expenses along with generate a expense report with a time range. But as I implemented it, I felt that the users should be able to manipulate their own data rather than everyone else's. So I made an additional role such as Admin that gives them complete control to delete or update any user's info. The users themselves will only be able to delete their own account, create their expenses, etc.

The admin role is completely optional, I made it just so for proper use.
